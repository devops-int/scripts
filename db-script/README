Task:
Create an app that will send a request to the API https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity
It needs to check the response that the API will send and write it a database.
Automation test to be preformed 
The solution to be place in container

Implementation requires:
Create Mysql 5 Database from the AWS RDS service.
Also install Mysql 5 client on AWS Linux:
sudo yum update -y 
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm 
rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
sudo yum install mysql-community-server 
sudo systemctl enable mysqld 
sudo systemctl start mysqld 

CREATE DATABASE INFO;
USE INFO;
CREATE TABLE Activity (
    Description varchar(300)
);
SHOW TABLES;

Run the script:
chmod 777 check.py
python3 check.py

Moving the script to container and running it:
Create new directory and move the script in it.
In the same directory start building the docker image. 
vim Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install requests
RUN pip install mysql-connector-python
CMD ["python3", "./check.py"]

sudo docker build -t myapp .
sudo docker run myapp

Login to the database to validate that after running the container the database was updated with new entry.
